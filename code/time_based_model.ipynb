    "# Fresh Idea\n",
    "## separate one/zero activity of domains\n",
    "- replace zeros by minus one\n",
    "- calculate the class activity for 3 hours bins for each domain\n",
    "- calculate the user activity for gaussian around center of 3 hour bins\n",
    "- calculate the likelihood of the person being a 1/-1 in that time \n",
    "- add user general metrics including domain cls activity and usage patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### questions\n",
    "- how to take into account times when the person used a website when others didnt?\n",
    "- how to give likelihood when the person didn't show any nearby activity?\n",
    "- what if he used a similar website at same time but more nich? \n",
    "- how to average the bins weighted by the significance of that bin?\n",
    "- how to give weight to the magnitude of number of users entering? probability of 1 with confidence\n",
    "- what about sparse websites?\n",
    "- how to not let times where there are no activity take a lot of weight?\n",
    "### enhancements\n",
    "- create graph embedding of urls\n",
    "- for each bin, calculate the metric per url\n",
    "- instead of only looking at the specific website, take into account websites with similar usages,\n",
    "  for example looking at same domain_cls usage in gaussian around bin, or looking at domain embeddings and looking at the activity in similar embeddings weighted by the distance in the embedding space\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOTICE:\n",
    "the data itself will use all domains, even ones that the person never used. this could be an issue. \n",
    "first of all the fact that the person doesnt use them is an indication. we \n",
    "- we might want to take the niche websites and sum them up\n",
    "- we might want to remove them\n",
    "\n",
    "IDEA!\n",
    "- use different features for different people\n",
    "- make an ensemble that can differentiate between different users\n",
    "- take the people that get a wrong prediction and see if a classifier that is more \"fringe\" can classify them better\n",
    "- for example another tree classifier that takes a smaller amount of features to give more opportunity to fringe websites\n",
    "can create a classifier for each user type \n",
    "can take number of usages for each domain, and cluster people or PCA\n",
    "clustering is good - I can create a classifier for each cluster, from each cluster take all of the available data for all of the visited domains, and create a classifier for them. use only data from those users or all users that used one of the websites, plus the general model, for each cluster - use cluster model and general model.\n",
    "also - I can multiply the features by the log of usages\n",
    "\n",
    "another idea is to simply average the most prominent websites weighted by the specific user usages, and the general usage\n",
    "\n",
    "USER CLUSTER AS FEATURE - or PCA coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "an idea - see how chaotic are the subject's patterns, if it's too predictable then it might be a bot\n"
